# ETL Project
# Impact of Brewery Trend on DUI

ETL Proposal:	ETLProject/ETL Proposal.docx

# Background
The purpose of this project is to analyze the American breweries database, compare it with US DUI data and establish any correlation between these two. 

# Data sources
Initial csv files were imported from “Kaggle”, and stored in our github Resource folder ETLProject/master/Resources, 
(1) beers.csv    (2)  breweries.csv     (3) breweriesUSA.csv    (4)open-beer-database.csv    (5) DUI.csv

# Technique/Technology
*Python/Pandas, was used to initial cleaning and visualizing the data. US-Breweries Data was scraped then grouped into state categories for better comparison between breweries and DUI data.  ETLProject/.ipynb_checkpoints/beerwork-checkpoint.ipynb
*SQL was used to transform the clean data into table form for proper data analysis
