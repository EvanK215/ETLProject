# ETL Project
# Impact of Brewery Trend on DUI

ETL Proposal:	ETLProject/ETL Proposal.docx

# Background
The purpose of this project is to analyze the American breweries database and compare it with US DUI data and try to establish any correlation between these two. 

# Data sources
Initial csv files were imported from “Kaggle”, and stored in our github Resource folder ETLProject/master/Resources, 
(1) beers.csv    (2)  breweries.csv     (3) breweriesUSA.csv    (4)open-beer-database.csv    (5) DUI.csv

# Technique/Technology
Python/Pandas was used to initial cleaning and visualizing the data. US-Data was extracted from the database then grouped into state categories for better comparison between breweries and DUI data

------Data Cleaning: Team faced bit challenges while cleaning the Data i.e different empty cells, same State name with different formats etc

# Files in the repository:



# ETLProject
Project to analyse different US Breweries Databases  and if there is a  correlation to an increase in DUI for different states
